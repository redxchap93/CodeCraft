# CodeCraft
AI-Powered DevOps &amp; Security Assistant
Iâ€™m excited to introduce CodeCraft Revolution, a full-stack Flask-based AI coding assistant designed to revolutionize the software development, testing, and security workflow.

ðŸ’¡ What Does It Do? âœ… AI-Powered Code Generation & Explanation: Just input your idea, and our AI models will generate structured code in Python, Bash, or PowerShell. It can also explain concepts in an easy-to-understand format.
âœ… Automated Code Correction & Optimization: A dedicated correction agent (deepseek-coder:latest) analyzes your script, fixes errors, improves structure, and enhances efficiency.
âœ… Execution & Testing in a Virtual Environment: Code execution is handled inside a secure virtual environment to prevent unexpected system-wide effects.
âœ… Automated Security Auditing with a Dedicated AI Agent: A security testing agent scans your script for vulnerabilities, suggests patches, and ensures best security practices.

ðŸ›  AI Model Suite
Weâ€™ve integrated a wide range of state-of-the-art AI models to handle generation, correction, testing, and security assessments:

Generation & Explanation:
deepseek-r1:1.5b, deepseek-r1:latest, deepseek-r1:70b, deepseek-r1:32b, deepseek-r1:7b, deepseek-r1:14b
qwen2.5:14b, qwen2.5:7b, qwen2.5:latest, qwen2:7b, qwen2:latest
mistral:latest, mistral-small:latest
llama3.3:latest, llama2:latest, llama3.1:8b, llama3:latest, llama3.1:latest, llama3.2-vision:latest, llama3.2:latest
Correction & Optimization:
deepseek-coder:latest (AI-powered code reviewer & optimizer)
nichealpham/port-correction:latest (Port correction agent for networking projects)
Security Testing & Hardening:
A specialized security agent analyzes code vulnerabilities, permissions, dependencies, and security flaws before deployment.
ðŸ”§ Key Features
ðŸ›  Code Correction, Testing & Execution:

Automatic AI-powered corrections improve code readability, efficiency, and performance.
Code runs inside a controlled virtual environment for safe execution & debugging.
Security agent checks for vulnerabilities, missing permissions, or exploits.
ðŸ”’ Integrated Security Analysis:

Every generated or user-provided script is analyzed for security flaws before execution.
Automated penetration testing capabilities built into the pipeline.
ðŸš€ Seamless GitHub Integration:

Connect with GitHub using a Personal Access Token to create & push repositories automatically.
Each project is generated with a structured README file, commit history, and documentation.
ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful Developer-Centric UI:

Dark mode, animated typewriter effect, intuitive UI, and real-time results display.
Who is This For?
âœ” Developers, DevOps Engineers, and Security Professionals who want faster, smarter, and more secure code development.
âœ” Cybersecurity Analysts who need automated security testing before deployment.
âœ” IT Automation Engineers looking for quick and efficient scripting solutions.

ðŸŽ¯ How CodeCraft Revolution is Changing the Game âœ… No more manual debugging â€“ our AI corrects errors in real-time.
âœ… Test scripts before deployment in a sandboxed virtual environment.
âœ… Security-first approach ensures your code is resilient against attacks.
âœ… AI agents act as coding mentors, security auditors, and DevOps engineersâ€”all in one tool.

This is just the beginning! ðŸš€
